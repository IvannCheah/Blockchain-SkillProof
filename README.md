## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User Registration**  
   Users request registration. Admin approves and assigns roles: Employee or Organization.

2. **Certificate Upload**  
   Employees upload certificates. Files are stored in IPFS, while metadata and hash are stored on-chain.

3. **Work Experience Validation**  
   Employees submit work experience which is then validated by the respective Organization through Ethereum transactions.

4. **Reputation Scoring**  
   Based on the level of certificate and work experience, users earn points that contribute to their rank on the leaderboard.
